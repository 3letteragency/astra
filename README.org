#+TITLE: Astra Docs and Planning
#+DESCRIPTION: Astra is a mission control framework for KSP to facilitate fully automated missions and operations. Also hoping to learn a bit about control theory in the process.

* Astra
** Tasks [0/4]
- [ ] R&D
  - [ ] Can we set up a headless/graphically limited KSP?
    * Running KSP in a VM seems promising.
      * Set all graphics settings to minimum
  - [ ] If not headless, can we automate the launching of KSP "instances", and entering/setting up the game as desired(specific missions, locations, etc.) via the [[https://krpc.github.io/krpc/cpp/api/ui/ui.html][kRPC UI API]]?
    * Might be able to use the Unity [[https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CLIBatchmodeCoroutines.html][Batch Mode]] and [[https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html][nographics]] options to facilitate headless.
    * Will need some means of automatically launching specified game saves.
      * [[https://github.com/allista/AutoLoadGame][AutoLoadGame]] might do the trick.
        * Might modify to use Unity CLI args instead of config file:

- [-] Stage 1 - Prep [0/3]
  - [ ] Base VM Image(Packer) [/]
    - [ ] KSP Installed
    - [ ] Mods installed
    - [ ] Loads arbitrary sfs game
  - [ ] Base sfs loaded by base image instances
    - [ ] kRPC AutoStarts and listening on 0.0.0.0
  - [X] Choose kRPC client language - C++
- [ ] RL Software integrations [0/2]
  - [ ] [[https://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/GMAT/index.php][GMAT]] - Planning
  - [ ] [[https://github.com/nasa/openmct][OpenMCT]] - Ops HUD
- [ ] Stage 2 - Data [0/1]
  - [ ] Set up all kRPC Data Stream
    # * Pipe into GMAT and OpenMCT ???
** KSP Mod Requirements
- [[https://krpc.github.io/krpc/][kRPC]] - kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of the game.
- [[https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki][Realism Overhaul]] - Its not certain this will place nice with [[https://krpc.github.io/krpc/][kRPC]], however realistic(ish?) control theory is really the purpose of this project so we will proceed with it until/unless we encounter problems.
- [[https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/][kOS]] - kOS might be useful for some simpler tasks where we don't want the full power of kRPC. Might use, might not. We'll see.
** On Hold
  - [X] Do I even want to use KSP? This [[http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/index.html][Orbiter Space flight simulator]] seems interesting:
    * Results: perhaps I'll work up to this at some point...
